# Faucet List with Timers

This is a simple, client-side faucet list application that helps you keep track of your favorite faucets and their claim timers. It is a standalone HTML application that runs entirely in your web browser, using `localStorage` to save your data.

This project was originally a WordPress plugin but has been converted into a static application that can be easily hosted on services like GitHub Pages or run locally.

## Features

*   **Add and Remove Faucets:** Easily add your favorite faucets with their name, URL, and a claim timer in minutes.
*   **Automatic Timers:** Each faucet has a countdown timer that shows when it's ready to be claimed again.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Your faucet list is saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so it persists between sessions on the same device and browser.
*   **Client-Side:** No server or database is required. Just open the `index.html` file in a browser.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository or download the `index.html` file.**
2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**
3.  **Add your faucets using the form.**

Your list will be saved automatically and will be there when you reopen the page.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

You can easily host this application on your own GitHub Pages site:

1.  **Fork this repository.**
2.  **Go to the "Settings" tab of your forked repository.**
3.  **Navigate to the "Pages" section.**
4.  **Under "Source," select your `main` (or `master`) branch and click "Save."**
